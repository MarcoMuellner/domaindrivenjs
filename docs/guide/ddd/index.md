# Introduction to Domain-Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on building a deep understanding of the domain or business area that the software supports. This understanding is then used to inform the design and development of the software.

## Core Principles of DDD

### Focus on the Core Domain

The core domain is the part of the business that is most important and where the software can provide the most value. By identifying this, development efforts can be focused on the areas that matter most.

### Model the Domain in Code

A key principle of DDD is creating a model of the domain in code that both developers and domain experts can understand. This model should use terms and concepts from the business domain (the ubiquitous language) and should be constantly refined as understanding of the domain deepens.

### Collaborate with Domain Experts

Domain experts are people who understand the business domain deeply. In DDD, developers work closely with these experts to build a shared understanding of the domain and to model it accurately in code.

### Bounded Contexts

A bounded context is a clear boundary within which a particular domain model applies. This allows different parts of a large system to use different models, acknowledging that a single model might not be appropriate for an entire complex system.

### Ubiquitous Language

The ubiquitous language is a shared language used by both developers and domain experts. It should be used in all parts of the project, from discussions to documentation to the code itself.

## Strategic vs. Tactical DDD

Domain-Driven Design can be divided into two main areas:

### Strategic Design

Strategic design focuses on the big picture:
- Defining bounded contexts and their relationships
- Understanding the core domain and subdomains
- Creating a context map
- Establishing the ubiquitous language

### Tactical Design

Tactical design focuses on the implementation patterns:
- Value Objects
- Entities
- Aggregates
- Domain Events
- Repositories
- Services
- Factories

## Why Use DDD?

Domain-Driven Design offers several benefits:

- **Shared Understanding**: A common language and model between technical and business teams
- **Focus on Business Value**: Emphasizes what matters most to the business
- **Manageable Complexity**: Provides patterns to handle complex domains
- **Flexible and Maintainable**: Creates a model that can evolve with the business
- **Better Communication**: Improves communication across teams with the ubiquitous language

## When to Use DDD

DDD is particularly valuable when:

- The domain is complex
- The project is expected to have a long lifespan
- There's a need for close collaboration between technical and domain experts
- The business logic is central to the application's success

For simpler domains or short-lived projects, a full DDD approach might be overkill.

## DDD with Domainify

Domainify provides a set of tools to implement tactical DDD patterns in JavaScript. It focuses on:

- Creating a clean, expressive domain model
- Enforcing invariants and business rules
- Promoting immutability and type safety
- Enabling event-driven architecture

In the following sections, we'll explore these concepts in more detail and show how Domainify helps you implement them.
