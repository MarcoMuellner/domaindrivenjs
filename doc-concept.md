# Domainify Documentation Concept

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for building the Domainify documentation using VuePress. The documentation will not only explain how to use the Domainify library but also serve as a valuable resource for learning Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts.

## Documentation Goals

- Provide clear, beginner-friendly introduction to Domainify
- Teach foundational DDD concepts with concrete examples
- Serve as a comprehensive reference for the API
- Present information in a friendly, approachable manner (similar to Fastify docs)
- Follow a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts
- Be visually appealing with diagrams and illustrations

## Technical Setup

### VuePress Configuration

We'll use VuePress v2 for the documentation site with the following setup:

```bash
# Project structure
docs/
├── .vuepress/            # VuePress configuration
│   ├── config.js         # Main configuration file
│   ├── public/           # Static assets (images, logo, etc.)
│   └── theme/            # Custom theme components (if needed)
├── index.md              # Home page
├── guide/                # Main documentation
├── api/                  # API reference
└── examples/             # Example code and use cases
```

### GitHub Pages Deployment

We'll set up GitHub Actions for automated deployment:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/docs.yml
name: Deploy Docs

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['docs/**']

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: cd docs && npm install
      - name: Build
        run: cd docs && npm run build
      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./docs/.vuepress/dist
```
