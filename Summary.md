DomainDrivenJS: Building a Modern DDD Library - Project Summary
What We Set Out to Build
We've designed a modern, composition-first approach to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in JavaScript. Our library, called DomainDrivenJS, aims to make implementing DDD principles more accessible, with reduced boilerplate and improved developer experience compared to traditional inheritance-based approaches.
Core DDD Concepts Explored
We began by exploring essential DDD concepts that our library would need to support:

Ubiquitous Language - Creating a shared vocabulary between technical and domain experts
Value Objects - Immutable objects defined by their attributes
Entities - Objects with identity persisting across state changes
Aggregates - Clusters of objects treated as a single unit with invariants
Repositories - Collection-like interfaces for accessing domain objects
Domain Events - Representing significant occurrences within the domain
Domain Services - Operations not naturally belonging to specific entities
Bounded Contexts - Explicit boundaries for models
Specifications - Composable business rules

Key Technical Decisions
Through our discussions, we made several foundational technical decisions:

Composition Over Inheritance - Using factory functions to create domain objects instead of inheritance hierarchies
Zod for Validation - Leveraging Zod schemas for both runtime validation and TypeScript type inference
JavaScript with JSDoc - Choosing to write in JavaScript with rich JSDoc annotations rather than TypeScript
Immutability - Ensuring all domain objects are immutable with methods returning new instances
Extension via Adapters - Creating a clean adapter interface for pluggable infrastructure components
ESM-First Approach - Building with modern ES modules while maintaining CommonJS compatibility

Library Architecture
We designed a modular architecture with:

Core Package (@domaindrivenjs) - Fundamental DDD building blocks
Adapter Packages (@domaindrivenjs/*) - Optional adapters for specific technologies (MongoDB, Prisma, Redis)
Separation of Domain and Infrastructure - Clean boundaries between domain logic and infrastructure concerns

Project Setup Decisions
For the project setup, we decided on:

PNPM - For package management
Vitest - For testing
ESLint & Prettier - For code quality and consistency
TSConfig - For TypeScript checking of JavaScript files and .d.ts generation
Dual Package Publishing - Supporting both ESM and CommonJS consumers

Configuration Deep Dive
We explored the reasoning behind each configuration setting:

TSConfig - Understanding how each setting supports JavaScript with JSDoc
Module Setup - Configuring package.json for proper ESM and CJS support
Configuration Format - Recognizing that JavaScript configuration files are suitable for an ESM project

Key Learnings
Throughout our design process, we gained several insights:

DDD Building Blocks - Understanding how traditional OOP-based DDD concepts can be reimagined with functional composition
Type Safety Without TypeScript - How JavaScript with JSDoc can provide most of TypeScript's benefits with less overhead
Extensibility Models - The value of clean adapter interfaces over monolithic plugins
Project Configuration - The reasoning behind various TypeScript, ESM, and testing configurations
Immutability Patterns - How to ensure immutability in domain objects without excessive complexity

Next Steps
The foundation we've laid sets us up to implement the core components of DomainDrivenJS:

Complete the Value Object implementation
Implement Entity and Aggregate patterns
Build the Domain Event system
Create the Repository abstraction
Develop the Specification pattern
Build testing utilities for domain objects

With this design and setup, DomainDrivenJS is positioned to provide a modern, developer-friendly approach to Domain-Driven Design that aligns with contemporary JavaScript best practices.
